# columbia-card-task

## Overview

The Columbia Card Task is a risk-taking evaluation test using a grid of cards. One (or sometimes more) of these cards will be a "loss card" which deducts a significant amount of points from the participant and the rest will award a small number of points. Participants can flip as many cards as they like before continuing to the next round unless they flip the loss card, in which case they will advance to the next trial immediately. Participants' round scores accumulate over the course of the experiment and they are shown their total score at the end.
